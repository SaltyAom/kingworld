## Philosophies
Building on top of 3 philosophies:

- Performance
    - You shall not worry about the underlying performance
- Simplicity
    - Simple building blocks to create an abstraction, not repeating yourself
- Flexibility
    - You shall be able to customize most of the library to fits your need

Designed with TypeScript in mind, you don't need to understand TypeScript to take advantage of KingWorld. The library understands what you want and automatically infers the type from your code.
